# About michaellouie.xyz

This is my official personal portfolio website repo hosted on my local web server accepting traffic for michaellouie.xyz queries. While a strong resume gives recruiters and hiring managers a general idea about I did and what time, it does not convey cleary on how proficient I am at a particular skill or technology. Extending the resume to more than one page would be too much to read.

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Material Design framework "[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)", I have created 
this website allowing me to showcase my skills and expertise in a visually pleasing and navigable fashion. I injected a bit of my personality into each page and more details to my portfolio projects and experiences.

### --- Possible questions ---

#### Q. How do I go about claiming my domain and/or building my website?
A. I am currently writing a separate tutorial from the prospective of someone not too web-dev-savy but knows enough to talk about it. In the mean time, there are many tutorials out there that can give you the information you need to get started. Here's a rough idea though:

1. Buy a domain from a registrar (e.g. GoDaddy). To make it easier for visitors to memorize your domain name, avoid extra characters such as hyphens.
2. Search the Internet to find example websites that you like. There are many out there with different purposes, designs, and functionalities.
3. Identity the purpose of your website, what you would like to see on it, and what you want your visitors to do with it.
4. Sketch out the design and layout.
5. Code it.
6. View/test on the web.
7. Determine your hosting type (virtual host, rent server, personal hosting, etc).
8. Setup hosting.
9. Change DNS settings from your registrar by having say your A record point to the device of hosting web server.
10. Wait 24-48 hours.

#### Q. Are you a web developer?
A. While it is not my primary concentration, I enjoy using web development elements where necessary.

#### Q. Why not use a website builder such as WordPress?
A. Personally, I wanted to learn about web development from nothing. I'm pretty sure using one of the many free website builder out there that could have saved me much time and offer more functionality than what I have now but I wanted the experience building one starting from line 1. Plus, I don't want to pay for extra stuff and don't want my original domain name modified. Most importantly, I wanted the freedom to build my site the way I envisioned without being limited to web builder's features.

#### Q. Can I use your website to build my own?
A. Sure thing! Please fork from my repo so I know who I have influenced in making the website. However, my website has formatting, arrangements, and other elements that best fitted my needs and desires. Some of them may not be appropriate for you or don't like. Therefore, I would highly recommend you integrate the things you liked about my website into your own and change/disregard the rest.

#### Q. How long did it take to make this website?
A. About two weeks given some experience in web development. I planned only enough to get a rough idea of how I wanted my website to look like and research on the technologies I wanted to leverage. Most of my time was spent experimentation. I actually changed my mind on many elements of my site many times. Lessons learned - experiment where necessary but plan/design carefully ahead of laying hands on keyboard.

#### Q. Can I buy your domain?
A. No. I also kindly request that you refrain from calling, texting, and emailing me about buying my domain.

#### Q. Can I build your website?
A. No. That's already done.

#### Q. Can I make your logo?
A. Thank you for offering, but that won't be necessary for now.

#### S. I have a legal issue with you owning this domain name.
A. Please contact me so we can talk about it. My intention was to have a personal website named after my name, nothing more.

#### S. I have a legal issue with your website content.
A. Please contact me so we can talk about it. All content is based on generated elements using MIT Licensed software, royalty-free images, or personally made.
